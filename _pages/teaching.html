At the University of Iowa, I have taught various courses in the Departments of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Psychological and Brain Sciences, and Linguistics.

The courses I most frequently teach are Statistics and Experimental Methods, Psychology of Language, and Psychology of Social Labels.

My approach to teaching classes such as Psychology of Social Labels involves the Socratic method, where each class focuses on questions and dialogue. Through these conversations, we learn the theory behind label use.

In other classes, such as Statistics and Experimental Methods and Psychology of Language, I use applied datasets and real-world examples to engage studentsâ€™ interest in the topic.

All of my classes are built on a common theme of compassion and learning through experience. I pursue this goal by continuously and reflexively updating my teaching materials based on each cohort's needs.
